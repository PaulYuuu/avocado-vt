Avocado.

The recommended way of installing Avocado-VT is through RPM packages.
Documentation on how to install it can be found on `Read the Docs <http://avocado-vt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/GetStartedGuide.html>`__.

For a more interactive and auto-updating experience, you can also refer to
the `Avocado-VT DeepWiki page <https://deepwiki.com/avocado-framework/avocado-vt>`__,
which provides a different way to browse and search the project's
documentation.
